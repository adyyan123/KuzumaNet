# KuzumaNet

Kuzuma is a simple DDoS Botnet that have persistence system to keep the zombies connected, and can be used Out-Lan.

You can keep the connection with the bots as long as you type 'exit' first and then close it, that is veeeery important :)

This botnet works through a server and client file, but as I said, this is just the first version I will be making changes and improvements. 


Any suggestion can be made to me by discord zSodex#3828
